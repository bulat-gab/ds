The true class is contained in the OpenStatus variable, which is available only for the training set (in train.csv). You are asked to predict this variable for each question in the test set (in test.csv) and to submit your predictions in the same format as the format of sample submission.csv. I.e. your submission should have  2 columns - PostIds and predicted classes for respective PostId. Submission should contain a header and predicted class for each post in the test set.
